<p>I've only started using GitHub and I'm enjoying the process of learning. I took it upon myself to try this tool out as my colleagues are using it in their daily work. I see its value, but I still don't completely understand what's going on... There are some discussions that I completely go blank, but this doesn't discourage me... it actually pumps me up even more! </p>

<p>There's no limit to learning and growing! We're all capable of something more if we just keep on moving forward.</p>

<p>Here are a few tips to learning</p>

<ul>
<li>Keep an open mind.</li>
<li>Do not be afraid to ask. </li>
<li>Do not be afraid to stumble and make mistakes.</li>
<li>Do not dwell on your mistakes.</li>
<li>Be curious.</li>
<li>Have fun!</li>
</ul>
