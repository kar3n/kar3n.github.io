I see its value, but I still don't completely understand what's going on... There are some discussions that I completely go blank, but this doesn't discourage me... it actually pumps me up even more! \r\n\r\nThere's no limit to learning and growing! We're all capable of something more if we just keep on moving forward.\r\n\r\nHere are a few tips to learning\r\n- Keep an open mind.\r\n- Do not be afraid to ask. \r\n- Do not be afraid to stumble and make mistakes.\r\n- Do not dwell on your mistakes.\r\n- Be curious.\r\n- Have fun!\r\n",
